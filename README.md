**[VClubs](https://www.vclubs.org/) is my personal project during summer 2020, before my senior year in high school ðŸŽ“, which also happens to be during the pandemic**

The initiation became offical website for my school, created lasting school-wide impact on club operations, and widely acclaimed by students, clubs, and teachers.

It still operates today at www.vclubs.org though without frequent maintenance by my team.
